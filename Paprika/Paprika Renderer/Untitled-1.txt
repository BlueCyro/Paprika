# Re-think graphics pipeline

Firstly, we need to scope. This. Down!!!! Building a whole graphics pipeline is hard as hell. Let's define what this should support once and for all.


Supported features:

- Triangle rendering
- Attribute interpolation
- Pixel lighting
- ONE texture per material
- Render buffers
- That's it!!!


Supported vertex attributes:

- Position
- Vertex normal
- UV
- Color
- 3 extra floating-point attributes


# How the hell do we make this thing FASTER???

Store triangles as AoSoA (Array of structures of arrays)?

- Taking inspiration from Bepu Physics triangles a little bit
- Nix overlapped fields - make bounds checking ubiquitous for 3D and 2D
- Nix overlapped triangle matrix - just transform it normally, it's probably faster (and easier to manage)
